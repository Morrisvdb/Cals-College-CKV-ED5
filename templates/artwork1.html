{% block description %}
    Above you can see an image oof ARPANET. This was the firstmost version of the internet and connected a few computers across the USA with oneanother. 
    The ARPANET was the first packet-switching network and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet.
    The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.
    The packet-switching technology used in the ARPANET was based on concepts and designs by British scientist Donald Davies and American Paul Baran.

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    I found this artwork to be suitable for the museum because it is the first version of the internet and is a very important part of the history of the internet.
